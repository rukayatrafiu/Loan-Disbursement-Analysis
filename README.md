## Insights

- The highest loan disbursement was in March, indicating a surge in financial activity or loan demands during this period.
- June and July also saw significant disbursements, suggesting consistent loan activity across the summer.
- Officers like AOC and EQIU are high performers, managing a substantial portion of the disbursement volume.
- The current Portfolio at Risk (PAR) for loans overdue by 30 days or more stands at 14.683%, which may require strategic interventions to mitigate risks and improve loan recovery rates.

## Recommendations

- Loan Recovery Focus: The PAR 30% value indicates a moderate level of risk. Initiatives should be launched to reduce this by improving collections and borrower engagement.
- Incentivizing Top Performers: Officers with high disbursement volumes should be recognized and rewarded, encouraging consistent performance across the team.
- Branch-Level Analysis: Branches and loan products performing poorly in disbursements or showing higher delinquency rates should be identified and provided with targeted support.

## Conclusion

This Loan Disbursement report provides critical insights into financial performance and can be a valuable tool for loan portfolio managers, analysts, and decision-makers in financial institutions. The visual representation of key metrics allows for effective monitoring and strategic planning.
